This series of exercises is addressed to people who are familiar with _Java_ and have a basic understanding of _Spring_ / _Spring Boot_.   
They are intended to be performed in sequence, as each exercise builds on top of the code created by the previous ones.  
Guidelines become less specific as the exercises move on, providing only hints and useful links in some cases. The purpose is to encourage the engineer to search for online guides and then reflect on what the best solution would be in order to cover the exercises' requirements. 
The code is to be reviewed by a Senior colleague after completion of each exercise and feedback should be provided, before moving on to the next exercise. 

For some exercises software installation is required (e.g. Kafka, DB).For those it is advised to use Docker containers, as out-of-the-box solutions.

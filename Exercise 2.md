| a    | Create `User` class under package `domain`. Add the following fields, along with getters and setters:  <br/> - id (int)   <br/>- name (string)    <br/>- active (boolean)                                                                                                                  |
| b    | Create `UserController` class under package `controller` and `MockUserService` class under package `service`.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| c    | Pre-populate `MockUserService` with a hardcoded list of users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| d    | Create new `GET` operation in `UserController` that calls `MockUserService` and returns all users in JSON format. Operation will not have any input arguments. You will need to create a method inside `MockUserService` as well.                                                          |
| e    | Create new `GET` operation in `UserController` that calls `MockUserService` and returns a single user in JSON format. Operation will receive user id as input. You will need to create a method inside `MockUserService` as well.                                                          |
| f    | Create Unit Tests for the new operations of `UserController`, by using `MockMvc` and mocking `MockUserService`. Verify that the correct user(s) are returned, depending on your hardcoded data.  <br/> Create additional tests in separate class for the methods inside `MockUserService`. |
| g    | In case user id is not found, throw `BadDataException`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| h    | Create Unit Test for `MockUserService` to handle the case of non-existing user. Verify that `BadDataException` is thrown.                                                                                                                                                                  |

| a    | Add new property in `application.yml` or `application.properties`. Property should indicate whether new users should be active by default or not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| b    | Read new property in `MockUserService`. You can do so by using `@Value` (see https://www.baeldung.com/spring-value-annotation).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| c    | Create new `POST` operation in `UserController` that receives a user name as input and adds this user to the current list of users. You will need to create the respective method inside `MockUserService` as well. User id should be randomly generated and active flag should be set according to the new property. The operation should then return the newly created user object. |
| d    | Create new `DELETE` operation in `UserController` that calls `MockUserService` and removes a single user from the list of users. Operation will receive user id as input. You will need to create a method inside `MockUserService` as well.                                                                                                                                          |
| e    | Create new `PUT` operation in `UserController` that calls `MockUserService` and toggles the status of a specific user. Operation will receive user id as input. You will need to create a method inside `MockUserService` as well.                                                                                                                                                    |
| f    | Create Unit Tests for all new operations of `UserController` and  `MockUserService`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| g    | Run all tests and check current code coverage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| h    | Add _Swagger_ libraries and respective configuration to the project (see https://www.baeldung.com/swagger-2-documentation-for-spring-rest-api). Verify API is visible in browser (http://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui/)                                                                                                                                                              |
